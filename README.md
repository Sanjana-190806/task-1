This project aims to build a machine learning system that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. SVM is a powerful and widely used classification technique that works well for binary classification problems like diabetes prediction. The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which includes various medical features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, insulin levels, and age. The goal is to create an accurate and efficient classifier that can assist in early detection of diabetes based on input health data.
